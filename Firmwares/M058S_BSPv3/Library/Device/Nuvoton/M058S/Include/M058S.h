 * |[0]     |GO_BUSY   |Go and Busy Status
 * |        |          |If the FIFO mode is disabled, during the data transfer, this bit keeps the value of 1. As

 * |        |          |0 = Writing 0 to this bit to stop data transfer if SPI is transferring.
 * |        |          |1 = In master mode, writing 1 to this bit to start the SPI data transfer; in slave
 * |        |          |mode, writing 1 to this bit indicates that the slave is ready to communicate with a
 * |        |          |master.
 * |        |          |NOTE: All registers should be set before writing 1 to this GO_BUSY bit. The

 * |[1]     |RX_NEG    |Receive on Negative Edge
 * |        |          |0 = The received data input signal is latched on the rising edge of SPICLK.
 * |        |          |1 = The received data input signal is latched on the falling edge of SPICLK.
 * |[2]     |TX_NEG    |Transmit on Negative Edge
 * |        |          |0 = The transmitted data output signal is changed on the rising edge of SPICLK.
 * |        |          |1 = The transmitted data output signal is changed on the falling edge of SPICLK.
 * |[7:3]   |TX_BIT_LEN|Transmit Bit Length
 * |        |          |This field specifies how many bits are transmitted in one transaction. Up to 32 bits
 * |        |          |can be transmitted.
 * |        |          |TX_BIT_LEN = 0x08 ... 8 bits
 * |        |          |TX_BIT_LEN = 0x09 ... 9 bits
 * |        |          |......
 * |        |          |TX_BIT_LEN = 0x1f ... 31 bits
 * |        |          |TX_BIT_LEN = 0x00 .. 32 bits
 * |[10]    |LSB       |LSB First
 * |        |          |0 = The MSB is transmitted/received first (which bit in SPI_TX0 and SPI_RX0
 * |        |          |register that is depends on the TX_BIT_LEN field).
 * |        |          |1 = The LSB is sent first on the line (bit 0 of SPI_TX0), and the first bit received
 * |        |          |from the line will be put in the LSB position of the RX register (bit 0 of SPI_RX0).
 * |[11]    |CLKP      |Clock Polarity
 * |        |          |0 = SPICLK idle low.
 * |        |          |1 = SPICLK idle high.
 * |[15:12] |SP_CYCLE  |Suspend Interval (master only)
 * |        |          |These four bits provide configurable suspend interval between two successive
 * |        |          |transmit/receive transaction in a transfer. The definition of the suspend interval is the
 * |        |          |interval between the last clock edge of the preceding transaction word and the first
 * |        |          |clock edge of the following transaction word. The default value is 0x3. The period of the
 * |        |          |suspend interval is obtained according to the following equation:
 * |        |          |(SP_CYCLE[3:0] + 0.5)*period of SPI clock
 * |        |          |Example:
 * |        |          |SP_CYCLE = 0x0 ... 0.5 SPICLK clock cycle
 * |        |          |SP_CYCLE = 0x1 ... 1.5 SPICLK clock cycle
 * |        |          |......
 * |        |          |SP_CYCLE = 0xe ... 14.5 SPICLK clock cycle
 * |        |          |SP_CYCLE = 0xf ... 15.5 SPICLK clock cycle
 * |[16]    |IF        |Interrupt Flag
 * |        |          |0 = Indicates that the transfer does not finish yet.
 * |        |          |1 = Indicates that the SPI controller has finished one unit transfer.
 * |        |          |NOTE: This bit can be cleared by writing 1 to itself.
 * |[17]    |IE        |Interrupt Enable
 * |        |          |0 = Disable SPI unit transfer interrupt.
 * |        |          |1 = Enable SPI unit transfer interrupt.
 * |[18]    |SLAVE     |Slave Mode Enable Bit
 * |        |          |0 = Master mode.
 * |        |          |1 = Slave mode.
 * |[19]    |REORDER   |Byte Reorder Function Enable
 * |        |          |0 = Byte Reorder function Disabled.
 * |        |          |1 = Byte Reorder function Enabled.
 * |        |          |A byte suspend interval will be inserted among each byte.
 * |        |          |The period of the byte suspend interval depends on the setting of SP_CYCLE.
 * |        |          |Note:
 * |        |          |1. Byte Reorder function is only available if TX_BIT_LEN is defined as 16, 24, and 32 bits.
 * |        |          |2. In Slave mode with level-trigger configuration, the slave select pin must be kept at active state during the
 * |        |          |   byte suspend interval.
 * |[21]    |FIFO      |FIFO Mode Enable
 * |        |          |0 = FIFO mode Disabled.
 * |        |          |1 = FIFO mode Enabled.

 * |        |          |The time-out counter resets and starts counting (the counting clock = baud rate) whenever the RX FIFO receives a new data word.
 * |        |          |Once the content of time-out counter is equal to that of time-out interrupt comparator (TOIC (UA_TOR[7:0])), a receiver time-out interrupt (INT_TOUT) is generated if TOUT_IEN (UA_IER [4]) enabled.
