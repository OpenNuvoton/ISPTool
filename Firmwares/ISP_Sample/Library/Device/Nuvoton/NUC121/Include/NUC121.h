     * |        |          |If AUTOSS bit is cleared, setting this bit to 1 will set the slave select signal to active state, and setting this bit to 0 will set the slave select back to inactive state.
     * |        |          |If the AUTOSS function is enabled (AUTOSS = 1), the setting value of this bit will not affect the current state of slave select signal.
     * |        |          |Note: In SPI protocol, the internal slave select signal is active high.
     * |[3]     |AUTOSS    |Automatic Slave Select Function Enable (Master Only)
     * |        |          |0 = Slave select signal will be controlled by the setting value of SS (USPI_PROTCTL[2]) bit.

     * |        |          |The slave select signal will be asserted by the SPI controller when transmit/receive is started, and will be de-asserted after each transmit/receive is finished.
     * |[7:6]   |SCLKMODE  |Serial Bus Clock Mode
     * |        |          |This bit field defines the SCLK idle status, data transmit, and data receive edge.
     * |        |          |MODE0 = The idle state of SPI clock is low level
     * |        |          |Data is transmitted with falling edge and received with rising edge.
     * |        |          |MODE1 = The idle state of SPI clock is low level
     * |        |          |Data is transmitted with rising edge and received with falling edge.
     * |        |          |MODE2 = The idle state of SPI clock is high level
     * |        |          |Data is transmitted with rising edge and received with falling edge.
     * |        |          |MODE3 = The idle state of SPI clock is high level
     * |        |          |Data is transmitted with falling edge and received with rising edge.
     * |[11:8]  |SUSPITV   |Suspend Interval (Master Only)
     * |        |          |This bit field provides the configurable suspend interval between two successive transmit/receive transaction in a transfer
     * |        |          |The definition of the suspend interval is the interval between the last clock edge of the preceding transaction word and the first clock edge of the following transaction word
     * |        |          |The default value is 0x3
     * |        |          |The period of the suspend interval is obtained according to the following equation.
     * |        |          |(SUSPITV[3:0] + 0.5) * period of SPI_CLK clock cycle
     * |        |          |Example:
     * |        |          |SUSPITV = 0x0 ... 0.5 SPI_CLK clock cycle.
     * |        |          |SUSPITV = 0x1 ... 1.5 SPI_CLK clock cycle.
     * |        |          |.....
     * |        |          |SUSPITV = 0xE ... 14.5 SPI_CLK clock cycle.
     * |        |          |SUSPITV = 0xF ... 15.5 SPI_CLK clock cycle.
     * |[14:12] |TSMSEL    |Transmit Data Mode Selection
     * |        |          |This bit field describes how receive and transmit data is shifted in and out.
     * |        |          |TSMSEL = 000b: Full-duplex SPI.
     * |        |          |TSMSEL = 100b: Half-duplex SPI.
     * |        |          |Other values are reserved.
     * |        |          |Note: Changing the value of this bit field will produce the TXRST and RXRST to clear the TX/RX data buffer automatically.
     * |[25:16] |SLVTOCNT  |Slave Mode Time-out Period (Slave Only)
     * |        |          |In Slave mode, this bit field is used for Slave time-out period
     * |        |          |This bit field indicates how many clock periods (selected by TMCNTSRC, USPI_BRGEN[5]) between the two edges of input SCLK will assert the Slave time-out event
     * |        |          |Writing 0x0 into this bit field will disable the Slave time-out function.
     * |        |          |Example: Assume SLVTOCNT is 0x0A and TMCNTSRC (USPI_BRGEN[5]) is 1, it means the time-out event will occur if the state of SPI bus clock pin is not changed more than (10+1) periods of fDIV_CLK.
     * |[28]    |TXUDRPOL  |Transmit Under-run Data Polarity (for Slave)
     * |        |          |This bit defines the transmitting data level when no data is available for transferring.
     * |        |          |0 = The output data level is 0 if TX under run event occurs.
     * |        |          |1 = The output data level is 1 if TX under run event occurs.

     * |        |          |0 = SPI Protocol Disabled.
